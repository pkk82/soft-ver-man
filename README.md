### Software Version Manager (soft-ver-man)

The rationale behind creating this application is to address several key needs in software development. 
Firstly, the ability to download software from different locations, such as the internet or disks, 
allows users to access a wide range of resources and expand their development capabilities. 
Secondly, the application aims to be compatible with multiple operating systems, 
enabling developers to work seamlessly across various platforms.

Transparency regarding installation locations is another crucial aspect. 
By clearly indicating where software is installed, users can easily locate, manage and remove their tools. 
Additionally, the application seeks to simplify the process of switching between different versions of software. 
This functionality ensures that developers can test their code and experiment with different environments efficiently.

While inspired by nvm, which primarily focuses on managing different versions of Node.js, 
this application goes beyond that scope. 
It aims to support a diverse range of programming languages and software frameworks, 
providing developers with a comprehensive solution for managing their development environments. 
Lastly, the application's goal is to create developer environments in minutes, 
streamlining the setup process and enhancing productivity.
